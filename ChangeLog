	* Changelog: added.

	* tokthr2.S: added read, gets, fgets, tib, tibmax, tibsize, asm
	macro 'create'.  Now we can read input.  Added fif, floop, felse
	macros to calculate jump offsets for me; no more miscalculated
	jump offsets yielding puzzling bugs.

	* Makefile: somewhere along the line added this.

	* tokthr2.S: Bumped version from 2 to 3.  Added run-time
	dictionary of names.  Moved "instructions" (main program) to end
	of file.  For dictionary handling, added count, cr, words, dict,
	dictp, dictsize, nextwords, pastdict?, <, >=, 0=, cbcmp, c@+,
	bcmp, memcmp, unloop, find, r2@, 2swap.  Added "s: " label to .s
	output.

2007-11-12..14  Kragen Javier Sitaker  <kragen@thrifty>

	* tokthr2.S: Added "version 2", many comments.  Wrote
	define_bytecode, defasm, defbytes macros so I can stop writing
	bytecode numerically.  Shortened tail end of primitives with
	pusheax and pushedxeax.  Changed execute to execute a token.
	Implemented DO LOOP.  Removed direct threading, switched to a
	variant of "bit threading".  Added make_counted_string macro and
	words that will later be called -1 + 1- rot -rot tuck emit u. (u.)
	((u.)) ~ 1+ negate . printstack pick cells * depth - / cellsize
	nip i 2dup.

	* .gdbinit: somewhere along the line added this.

	tokthr.S: Tried out various things to see if they could shrink the
	machine code.

2007-11-10  Kragen Javier Sitaker  <kragen@thrifty>

	* tokthr.S: Have most of the basic primitives and have written a
	little bit of bytecode, but nothing that does anything
	interesting.

2007-11-09  Kragen Javier Sitaker  <kragen@thrifty>

	* tokthr.S: Prototyped four-instruction token-threaded "next"
	routine and wrote hello-world program with it.
