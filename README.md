**That’s the longest “hello world” I’ve *ever seen*!** -- [Bob Appleyard] [0]

This is a tiny token-threaded Forth interpreter that I started in 2007
and haven’t finished yet.  It’s about 1000 lines of x86 assembly,
using gas’s macro capabilities, and it compiles to about 1400 bytes of
executable, 399 of which are x86 code.  (The rest is bytecode.)

I don’t have a good name for it yet, and I don’t know if I’ll ever
finish it.  It’s in the public domain.
